##Evo 4X
Evo 4X is a minimalistic proof of concept, of tiny pixel art organisms that strive for surviving eating plankton or photosynthetize.
The world is proceduraly generated with a cellular automata algorithm.

##Technology: GameMaker v2024.13.1.193, GML
##State: early prototype, development paused.


##Goal
Survive longer than the computer's IA organisms.


#Mechanics
- Gain evolution points when your organisms feed, reproduce or die.
- Spend those points to evolve your organisms species at the top-right corner. The next children of that species will gain that adaptation.
- To gain the ever decreasing energy, eat plankton/the rival's organisms or evolve to get photosynthesis.


#Controls
- Left-Click owned organisms to control them
- Space to reproduce while selected.
- Left-Click while selected to move the organism. It consumes energy faster.
- Right-Click to unselect.
- Restart the game with "R".


#Tips
- Reproduce when you have energy since the energy splits in two
- Enemies or plankton with health will be tough to kill and will fight back. Proceed with caution.
- The world is divided by depths and surface, which can be toggled with the buttons at the bottom-left corner.
- The world's oceanic tiles has their own tide and currents which drags organisms with them. Use that to your advantage
- Every organism has an "Age" variable that will kill them past from a certain point.
- Even your own organism has their own AI so you don't HAVE to control them the whole time.
- Geisers makes the organisms go to the surface.
- North and south poles makes organisms go underwater.


#Every evolution trait explained
- Nucleo: the starting foundation of life.
- Flajelos: lets you move faster.
- Mitocondria: makes feeding convertion of energy more efficient.
- Colonia: makes the energy pool bigger.
- Esporulacion: placeholder, don't use it.
- Cloroplastos: you get photosynthesis. Progresivelly gain energy. This works better on the surface.
- Ficobiliproteina: Underwater photosynthesis works better.
- Clorofila B: Surface photosynthesis works better.
